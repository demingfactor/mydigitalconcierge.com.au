        <p>My Digital Concierge (aka Concierge) exists to provide a personalised human interface between people and beauracracy. <strong>Our initial offering is assistance with registering and managing MyGov Accounts and Adelaide Metro Concession Cards.</strong>          Client’s usually like to meet in the familiarity of their homes where they have all the necessary documents readily available. Reach out if you’d like to know more and also let us know if there are other services you’d like us to consider.</p>
